 The VSCP Websocket Server (WS1) protocol is a simple text-based protocol designed
 for communication between a VSCP device and a client over a WebSocket connection.
 The protocol allows clients to send commands to the device and receive responses,
 as well as receive events from the device in real-time.

 It is documented here
 https://grodansparadis.github.io/vscp-doc-spec/#/./vscp_websocket?id=ws1-description

  or a negative reply if authentication failed.
  The encrypted credentials is encrypted using the session ID (SID) as the IV and a
  pre-shared encryption key. The callback should decrypt the credentials using the session ID
  as the IV and the pre-shared secret key using AES-128 decryption. The decrypted credentials
  should be in the format "username:password".

  The callback should check the credentials and if correct add a pointer to a user structure with
  information about the authenticated user to the connection context. This information can then be
  used by other callbacks to determine what the user is allowed to do and not do.

  @param pcrypto A pointer to the encrypted credentials provided by the client for authentication.
  This should be a binary buffer containing the AES-128 encrypted credentials over "user:password".
  @param psid A pointer to a buffer holding a 128 bit session ID in binary form  that is used
  as the IV.
  @param pctx Pointer to the connection context.
  @return Returns VSCP_ERROR_SUCCESS if authentication was successful, or an appropriate error code if there was a
  failure.

  The callback should respond with

  "+;AUTH1;userid;name;;fullname;filtermask;rights;remotes;events;note"

  if the credentials are valid. The fields in the response are as follows:
  - userid: A unique identifier for the user (e.g. a numeric ID or UUID).
  - name: The username of the authenticated user.
  - fullname: The full name of the authenticated user.
  - filtermask: The event filter mask for the authenticated user in the standard comma seperated form.
  - rights: The permissions or rights assigned to the authenticated user as 63-bit number,
      represented as a hexadecimal string.
  - remotes: The remote hosts or clients that the authenticated user is allowed to connect from.
  - events: The events that the authenticated user is allowed to receive
