  This structure contains information about an authenticated user.
  It is used in the authentication process and may be populated with information
  from a user database or other source of user information. Some system may only
  allow for one user. In that case this structure can be populated with the information
  for that single user and the authentication process can simply check if the provided
  credentials match the information in this structure.

  Only the callbacks see this structure so the implementer may change it as he/she pleases.

  The fields in the structure are as follows:
  - username: The username of the user.
  - password: The password of the user (this should be encrypted or hashed in a secure manner).
  - fullname: The full name of the user.
  - filtermask: The filter mask for the user.
  - rights: The rights or permissions of the user. This can hold bits for rights this user has.
  - remotes: The remote access information for the user. This can be a comma-separated list of IP addresses or hostnames
  that the user is allowed to connect from.
  - events: The events associated with the user. This can be a comma-separated list of event types or IDs that the user
  is allowed to receive.
  - note: Any additional notes about the user.
