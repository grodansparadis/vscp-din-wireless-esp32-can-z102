  Send a raw payload over UDP as unicast or broadcast.

  @param payload Pointer to payload buffer
  @param payload_len Number of payload bytes to send
  @param destination_ip Destination string (example "192.168.1.10",

  @param destination_port Destination UDP port. If zero, configured UDP port
                          is used (or default VSCP UDP port if configured
                          value is also zero).
